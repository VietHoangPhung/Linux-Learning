- test psuedo device
- system calls 
- how block device read / write data?
- virtual memory 

imagine there is a led1 character device file, changing attribute mode: on/off will 
control the physical led. 
echo on > /dev/led1 
who is respondible for writing to the led1 file? 
after complete writing, 

led driver will process data and call another driver (from a module) to control actual gpio

major number: group device 
minor number: specific device

why they have to separate into major number and minor number? Why not just one for each device?
ioctl 

MODULE_LICENSE() ... 
wen module running, check for author and description

why exit flow is reversed compared to init

cuz del class first, kernel dont know where is the device

cdev is to register device, device's operations to the kernel 

cdev is for  the others to know, get the information, operations of the device. Not internal used

why separate into non discoverable and self discoverable?

two ways to insert platform devices

kmalloc kzalloc & free
devm_kzalloc
FLAG
